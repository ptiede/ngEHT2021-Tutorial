# ngEHT2021-Tutorial


This repository contains the tutorials shown in the ngEHT 2021 software tutorial session. The notebooks are written in either python or julia. 

## Installation

This assumes you have a working installation of python, julia, ipython, and eht-imaging. 

Most systems should have a working version of python installed. For Julia please install the official binaries from [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow the instructions there. To get julia to work with jupyter please then install the IJulia.jl package using the REPL. For example you can do
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
```
which should link to an installed version of jupyter.
